# Practicing-Data-Science-with-Books
This repository contains data analysis examples from the books I read and practice in the field of data analysis. <br>
To each of these books, a folder is allocated which contains the python code of examples and methods described in the respective book. <br>
Each folder is named after its respective book. <br>
New examples and codes are added as I read through the books. <br>
The list of the books, and thus, folders in this repository is in the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Data Analysis (with Open Source Tools)</li>
  <li>Python for Data Analysis</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, this list will be continued &#129310 <br>
