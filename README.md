# Practicing-Data-Science-with-Books
This repository contains data analysis examples from the books I read and practice in the field of data analysis. 
To each of these books, a folder is allocated which contains the python code of examples and methods described in the respective book.
Each folder is named after its respective book. 
New examples and codes are added as I read through the books. 
The list of the books, and thus, folders in this repository is in the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Data Analysis (with Open Source Tools)</li>
  <li>Python for Data Analysis</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, this list will be continued :)
